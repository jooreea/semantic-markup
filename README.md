# semantic-markup

## Description

In this repository, codebase for an existing marketing agency webpage is refactored so that it is optimized for search engines. The refactoring improves the source code's long-term sustainability and meets accessibility standards. 

It does so by the following the actions:
1. Ambiguous HMTL elements are replaced with semantic elements.
2. The structure of HTML elements are modified to follow a logical structure.
3. Icon and image elements are amended to include alt attributes.
4. Attributes are reorganized to fall in sequential order.
5. A descriptive title is included.
6. All links are checked and fixed to function correctly.
7. CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
8. The CSS file is ameneded to include descriptive comments.
